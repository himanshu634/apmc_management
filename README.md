# APMC management application

## Problem:
When farmers goes to APMC to sell their product they have to wait in long queue of almost 3-4 kilometers on the day of auction. That incurs many expanses to farmers like bills of transportaion so that they have very huge cut on their profit.

## Solution:
I have built this application that has feature to book slot in advance to sell their crops to vendors. So farmeres have to come to apmc market on the day of auction and time so that they do not have to wait in long queue to sell their products. This app also gives news and price of various products directly from apmc.

## Work-done:
-> Made feature to book slot of available crops.<br/>
-> Made simplified use of news feed screen.<br/>
-> Added otp authentication.

## Work to be done:
-> Make website for apmc side to add news and price details time to time.</br>
-> Polishing application.

## Tech stack used:
-> Flutter Framework(to make ui)<br/>
-> Firebase (for authentication and Storage.
